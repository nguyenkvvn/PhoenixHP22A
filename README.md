## Instructions

### Preparing the frame
1. Gently and carefully remove all supports on the frame.
  (Take care around the trigger guard. You may snap it off if you are too rough.)
  
2. Pre-score the pin holes.
  (Do this by gently tapping all the pins through their respective holes. They should slip through snugly, but not with a lot of resistiance.)

3. Dry-fit the barrel to make sure it can go in and out easily. Be sure the barrel lays perfectly parallel and is not angled up in any way. (If it is, gently file the sides of where the barrel's base seats above the trigger guard.)

4. Dry-cycle the slide to remove any aberrations that may cause the slide to bind. (Basically, break it in.)

### Installing the Trigger, Trigger Return Spring, and Barrel Mounting Pin
1. The thinnest silver pin is the pin for the trigger, and the smallest coil spring with a short+long arm is the trigger return spring.
2. Coming in from the _top_ of the frame, insert the trigger shoe into the trigger cut. Gently manuver the firing arm into the cutout on the right of the frame (barrel pointing to your right).
3. Using a pair of tweezers or pliers, insert the _short arm_ of the trigger return spring into the shoe. It may help to use the punch to stake and hold the trigger shoe in place while you do this.
4. Gently tap through the pin for the trigger, using your smallest punch to hold the trigger in place as you are tapping the pin.
5. Tap in the Barrel Mounting Pin, ensuring that the long arm of the trigger return spring is _under_ the pin.

### Installing the Extractor and Sear
1. Place the extractor in the cut-out in the rear of the frame, ensuring that the pin holes for the extractor line up with the pin holes in the rear of the frame. It **must** be perfectly flush with the wall of the frame.
2. Gently tap the _sear pin_ partially through the left of the frame, to hold the extractor in place.
3. Take the sear, and manuver it so that its arms are visible and places in the clearance cuts on the grips. Using a punch, align it to the sear pin on the extractor.
4. Gently tap the sear pin all the way through, ensuring that the sear pin is _between the "grips" on both sides of the frame._ This is important, because the sear pin sits between the slide's cuts.

### Installing the Sear Spring
1. On the left side of the frame, take the arm spring with one longer and shorter end, and insert it into the pocket. Push the base of the spring all the way into the pocket, until it can go no further using a set of needle-nose pliers.
2. Using the pliers, lift the longer arm of the spring up over the arm of the sear and then finally behind it. (Where behind the sear arm is between the protrusion of the grip and the pin hole for the hammer.)

### Installing the Hammer and Hammer Spring assembly
1. Take the hammer spring- it has two ends where one is wider and one is narrower. Insert the hammer spring into the magwell towards the backstrap, with the narrow end of the spring going in first.
2. Using the pliers, gently nudge the spring into the cutout in the backstrap.
3. Take the hammer spring rod- it has an end with a circle. Insert the end without the circle down into the spring from the top of the frame, with the curvature of the end with the circle pointing _away_ from the barrel. *Protip: have a punch the size of the trigger pin handy in your mouth.*
4. Now take the hammer, and seat the circular part of the hammer rod into the hammer. Using one finger inside the magwell, hold the spring against the backstrap as you push the hammer (in non-cocked position straight down!) and hammer rod down into the frame, compressing the spring. Remember that punch in your mouth? Using your hands to line up the pin hole for the hammer to hold it in place.
5. Insert the hammer pin, from one end, and tap it through the frame, using the punch to guide the hammer's pin hole so the pin slides through.

### Compressing and fitment the fire control group
Even though there are cut-outs for the widened areas of the sear and hammer are made, the nature of 3D printing means that the tolerances aren't exactly perfect. Hence, we need to "compress" the frame and break in the parts.

1. Using the plastic side of your ball-and-peen hammer, gently tap the _wall_ of the left and right side in the area where the hammer and sear are. **Be sure not to hit the rails- you can snap them off!** This will reduce the extra width of the frame caused by the fire controls, which will bind the slide.
2. Fitment check the slide to make sure it's able to move without binding against the walls. (Gently binding against the hammer is okay.)
3. If the slide still binds, file these areas:
- use the conical file to slightly carve out a concave stream on the _rail_ wall.
- use the flat file to sand down the outer "T"'s of the rails
- use the flat file to sand down the lower rail above the hammer pin. (Not the raised grip part, but above it.)
4. Rinse and repeat until you are able to move the slide reasonably.

### Installing the Disconnector Arm
1. Insert the disconnector arm into the frame from the top, with the pin hole of the arm seating into the pocket.
2. Ensure that the lip of the arm (away from the pin) is resting on top of the trigger bar.
3. Insert the M2 x 20mm screw through the disconnector pin, and place the nut on the left of the frame.
4. Tighten to snug, but not binding.
5. Test the movement of the disconnector arm. It should move without resistiance.

### Testing the function of the fire control group
1. **This is important:** NEVER let the hammer drop uncontrolled into the sear. You will crack the frame.
2. Cock the hammer all the way, and watch the movement of the sear. The sear should click and seat it self ready for the trigger to push against it.
3. With your thumb still on the hammer, pull the trigger and gently let the hammer down.
4. Did it work? If so, great! If not, tweak and align your parts as necessary.

### Installing the Takedown Lock Assembly
As with all 3D printed stuff, sometimes, they need tweaking to work correctly, especially with firearms. An issue encountered during development was that racking the slide would unlock the barrel from the frame. This is remedied with a set screw to prevent the takedown from entering the unlock position.

1. Tap the M2 Nut into the top of the frame so that it is as flush as possible. You can score the hole so it widens slightly.
2. Take the M2 x 12mm screw and start it through the underside of the frame.
3. Thread to completion through the frame, then back out so that it is flush with the frame.

### Installing the Barrel, Slide, Takedown
1. Place the takedown into the takedown slot of the frame, and insert the spring. (Orientation of the spring doesn't matter.)
2. Take the slide, and place it onto the frame as you slip the spring so it sits in between the frame and slide.
3. Using your fingers to capture the spring, pull the slide back to compress the spring all the way. Hold the slide back with one hand.
4. Insert the barrel, and push it down against the takedown.
5. Let the slide return home.
6. Manuver the takedown so that it is "locks" the barrel into place. (The takedown moves left to right. You want it to move towards the fire control group to lock the barrel.)
7. Use the takedown set screw to lock the takedown so that it does not move to the unlock position, but not so much that it makes contact with the springs.
8. Rack the slide to ensure that it cocks the hammer, and is able to move without binding. (It may take a few hundred movements to wear it in.)

That's it! Enjoy. Please feel free to give feedback on the design.
